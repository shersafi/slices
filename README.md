Slices - A Python screenshot tool with Google Cloud Platform integration.

## Running

To run Slices, you will need [Python3](https://www.python.org/) to run `slices.py`. Running the Python script will open a grey screen overlay with a cursor to select the region you would like to screenshot. Releasing the cursor will open a window to select whether you would like to send the screenshot to your clipboard or if you would like to upload it online.

## Required

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) to run the Python script.
- [GoogleCloudPlatform](https://cloud.google.com/) to upload the screenshots online
- Install external libraries found in `required.txt`

## To-do

Ensure to install the required. Afterwards, make sure to include a Google Authentication json to be able to use online image storage. Edit the bucket client accordingly. Everything else works out of the box.
